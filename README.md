# CSCS-Unity
Custom Scripting in C# in Unity

This is a Unity integration of "CSCS" a runtime scripting language developed by Vassili Kaplan at https://github.com/vassilych/cscs.

I created a Scriptable Object architecture framework with a integrated Message Bus based on a runtime scriptable object singleton.

This is integrated in the example, but easly removeable.

Some parts of the scriptable object framework use Odin Serializer it is under Apache 2.0 license, but again this dependency is easly removeable.

If you have any Ideas to improve this, let me know!
